# Release Planning Meeting (RPM.md)

## **Meeting Details**
- **Date:** March 7, 2025  
- **Time:** 11:30 AM  
- **Location:** Lassonde Building, after our lab  
- **Attendees:**  
  - Julia Da Silva  
  - Gurjap Hajra  
  - Rizikeshan Asohan  
  - Sam Antoun  

## **Release Goal**
The goal for **Sprint 1** is to develop two core features that form the foundation of CourseCompass:  
1. **Course Search** - Students can search for courses by subject, course code, or keywords.  
2. **Prerequisite & Post-requisite Course Links** - Students can view course prerequisites and what future courses a course unlocks.  

These features will **allow students to efficiently find courses and plan their academic progression**.

## **Scope of the Project (Key Features & Epics)**
For **Sprint 1**, we are focusing on the **course search functionality and prerequisite/post-requisite tracking**, which includes:

### **Key Feature 1: Course Search**
- Students should be able to **search for courses** using:
  - Course name  
  - Course code  
  - Subject/Department  

### **Key Feature 2: Prerequisite & Post-requisite Course Links**
- Each course page should display:
  - **Prerequisites** (courses required before taking this course).  
  - **Post-requisites** (courses that can be taken after completing this course).  
- Links should allow students to **quickly navigate between related courses**.

## **User Stories Selected for This Release**
The following user stories have been selected for **Sprint 1**:

1. **As a student, I want to search for courses by subject, course code, or keywords, so I can quickly find relevant courses.**  
2. **As a student, I want to see prerequisite and post-requisite courses for a selected course, so I can plan my academic trajectory.**  

## **Team Capacity & Role Assignments**
Each team member has been assigned specific responsibilities for Sprint 1:

| Team Member       | Role                 | Responsibilities |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Julia Da Silva   | Frontend Developer    | UI/UX design, implementing search and prerequisite/post-requisite links |
| Gurjap Hajra     | Backend Developer     | API integration for course search, database setup |
| Rizikeshan Asohan | Full Stack Developer | Connecting frontend and backend for search & prerequisite features |
| Sam Antoun       | Documentation    | Testing, writing documentation, reviewing pull requests |

## **Expected Challenges & Risks**
- **Handling large course datasets efficiently** to ensure fast search results.  
- **Ensuring prerequisite/post-requisite data is accurate and well-structured.**  
- **Designing a smooth user experience** so students can easily navigate between courses.  

## **Next Steps**
1. **Begin Sprint 1 development**, focusing on the search and prerequisite/post-requisite features.  
2. **Conduct regular standups** to monitor progress and resolve any blockers.
