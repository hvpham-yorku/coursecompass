# Competition Analysis for Course Search App

## Existing Products

### [York University's Course Search System](https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/10/wo/4tZMwIK5AanjbuGdDf443g/0.3.10.21)
- Provides course details, prerequisites, and course descriptions.
- Requires multiple external links to access full course details, making it frustrating and time-consuming for users.
- Lacks professor reviews, difficulty ratings, and personalized recommendations.
- Not user-friendly for new students or those who need quick, easily accessible course information.

### [RateMyProfessors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/)
- Focuses on professor ratings and reviews from students.
- Does not provide structured course information, prerequisites, or course recommendations.

## How Our Product is Different

Our course search app improves on existing solutions by integrating **comprehensive course information, professor insights, intuitive interface and specific focus on ease of use students**.
- Displays **course details, prerequisites, and post-requisites** all in one place, and highlighted rather than just a course code hidden in text.
- Includes past **professor ratings, reviews, and recommendations** to help students make informed choices.
- Offers a **single-page view** instead of requiring multiple clicks and external links.

## Target Users & Scenarios

### **Who Are the Users?**
1. **University Students Planning Their Courses**
   - Need a **clear view of prerequisite structures** before enrolling.
   - Want **professor reviews and difficulty ratings** to help select courses that match their learning style and workload capacity.
   - Prefer a **modern, easy-to-use interface** that provides all necessary information at a glance.

2. **New Students Exploring Courses**
   - Need an **intuitive way to understand course pathways** and requirements.
   - Want **professor recommendations and insights** to avoid difficult or poorly rated instructors.
   - Find traditional university course search systems **confusing or outdated**.

3. **Students Managing Workload and Schedule**
   - Seek courses that fit their academic and personal schedules.
   - Need **real student feedback on workload and difficulty**.
   - Prefer a **streamlined interface that minimizes excessive searching and clicking**.

## Why Competitors Did Not Focus on These Users

### **Limited Scope of University Systems**
- University course search tools are built for **basic course browsing**, not for in-depth decision-making.
- They lack integration with **student-generated insights, difficulty ratings, and professor recommendations**.

### **Focus on Institutional Priorities Over Student Experience**
- Official course search tools focus on listing **factual data**, rather than student-driven insights.
- Universities prioritize **administrative efficiency over user experience**.

### **RateMyProfessors and Similar Platforms Lack Course Integration**
- While RateMyProfessors provides professor reviews, it does not connect those reviews to specific institutions.
- Students must manually cross-check **course offerings and professor reviews**, leading to inefficiency.

## What It Would Take for Competitors to Focus on These Users

- **Improved Data Integration**: They would need to **combine course details with professor reviews, difficulty ratings, and student feedback**. This requires a team to collect, verify, and integrate large amounts of data, which takes significant time and resources.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Competitors would need to **redesign their platforms to be more user-friendly**, ensuring information is accessible in fewer clicks. This demands UX/UI improvements, software development, and testing, all of which require ongoing investment.
- **Institutional Policy Changes**: Universities would have to allow **more transparency in student reviews and feedback** within their course search systems. Implementing such a change would require administrative approval, legal considerations, and likely a shift in how universities manage course data.

Our platform addresses these gaps by **combining structured course data, professor insights, and student-driven feedback into a single, intuitive interface**.
