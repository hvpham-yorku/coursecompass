## Definition of Done  

Our *Definition of Done* (DoD) outlines the criteria that each feature must satisfy to be deemed complete. These standards, established through team consensus, apply to all user stories within CourseCompass.

### Functional Requirements  
Each feature meets all requirements and acceptance criteria outlined in the user story.  
- **Course Search Functionality**: The platform should allow students to search for courses by code, title, or department and apply filters for semester, course level, and type.
- **Professor Ratings and Reviews**: The platform should show professor ratings and reviews.
- **Prerequisite and Course Requirement Information**: The system should display prerequisite and co-requisite courses, with links to additional details.
- **Workload Estimates**: The system should provide estimated weekly workload details.

### Code & Architecture Standards  
Ensures maintainability, separation of concerns, and scalability.  
- **MVC Architecture**: Implements the MVC pattern to promote modularity and maintain a clear separation of concerns.
- **Full-Stack Implementation**: Utilizes the MERN stack to seamlessly integrate backend and frontend for a cohesive development experience.
- **CRUD Operations**: Provides robust support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to facilitate efficient data management.
- **Clean Code**: Maintains well-organized, readable code with clear commit messages and meaningful branch names to streamline version control and collaboration.

### Testing & Quality Assurance  
Verifies that each feature is functional, robust, and user-friendly.  
- **Unit Tests**: Assesses individual components to confirm they operate as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: Verifies smooth data flow between the frontend and backend to ensure proper integration.
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Evaluates the usability and effectiveness of features, particularly gamified elements, for a smooth user experience.
- **Edge Cases**: Tests extreme values to ensure the system remains stable under various conditions.
- **Peer Review**: Requires at least one team member to review code before merging, ensuring quality, consistency, and adherence to best practices.

### Documentation  
Provides clear guidance for developers and users to enhance understanding and usability.  
- **Code Comments**: Code includes comments for clarity and maintainability.
- **README** includes:
  - Project overview.
  - Installation and setup instructions for the stack (MERN stack).
  - Contribution guidelines (branch naming, pull requests) for streamlined collaboration.

---

### Team Review & Consensus  
Ensures all team members agree a feature is complete before marking it as "done."  
- **Peer Review**: Each feature is reviewed and approved by all team members before moving to the “Done” column on Trello.
- **Regular Check-Ins**: Team check-ins ensure all members adhere to these standards, including gamification-specific requirements and quality benchmarks.
