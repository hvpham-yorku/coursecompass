# CourseCompass: Project Summary

## Project Overview
CourseCompass is a next-generation course selection platform designed to simplify and enhance the university course registration process. By integrating comprehensive course details, professor ratings, and user-friendly features, CourseCompass enables students to make informed academic decisions efficiently. The platform eliminates the need for multiple websites and manual cross-referencing, creating a streamlined and accessible experience.

## Key Objectives
- **Comprehensive Course Discovery:** Provide a centralized database of course information, including descriptions, prerequisites, and professor ratings.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Equip students with workload estimates, past student reviews, and prerequisite tracking to guide course selection.
- **Accessibility & Usability:** Implement features such as dark mode, multilingual support, and adaptive font sizing to ensure an inclusive experience for all students.
- **Efficient Navigation:** Minimize time spent searching for courses by offering an intuitive interface with smart filters and personalized recommendations.

## Key Users & Their Needs
### First-Year Students (Emily Zhao)
- Need a structured and easy-to-navigate platform to explore courses and understand prerequisites.
- Seek reliable professor recommendations to avoid poor course choices.

### Upper-Year Students Managing Schedules (Rachel Nguyen)
- Require quick access to prerequisite and workload information to optimize their course load.
- Prefer a clutter-free design that allows for efficient searching and comparison.

### International Students (Miguel Oliveira)
- Benefit from visual course pathways and multilingual content to ease the course selection process.
- Need an intuitive system that clearly outlines eligible courses based on completed prerequisites.

## Key Use Cases & Features
- **Course Search & Filtering:** Students can search by subject, course code, or keywords, with advanced filtering options for level, workload, and credits.
- **Prerequisite & Eligibility Tracking:** A visual prerequisite map helps students understand course requirements and plan their academic trajectory.
- **Professor Comparisons & Reviews:** Integrated professor ratings and reviews allow students to evaluate teaching quality before enrolling.
- **Personalized Experience:** Features such as font resizing, dark mode, and saved course preferences enhance usability.
- **Multilingual Support:** Course descriptions can be translated into multiple languages, making information accessible to international students.

## Why CourseCompass?
- Existing university course search tools are often outdated, fragmented, and lack essential student-focused features.
- RateMyProfessors provides insights into teaching quality but does not integrate with course selection, forcing students to manually cross-reference information.
- CourseCompass fills this gap by offering a one-stop platform that combines structured course data, student-driven feedback, and intuitive navigation.

## Next Steps
- Prioritize the development of core features, including course filtering, prerequisite tracking, and professor ratings.
- Optimize the platform for accessibility and ease of use based on student feedback.
- Conduct usability testing to refine functionality and ensure a seamless user experience.

CourseCompass is designed to empower students with a stress-free and informed course selection process, ultimately maximizing academic success.
