- **Team Organization & Communication:**

  - The team adopted a structured approach to task distribution, ensuring that responsibilities were allocated fairly among members to maintain a balanced workload.

  - Communication was facilitated primarily through **Discord**, where a dedicated group chat was created. This platform allowed for real-time discussions, seamless file sharing, quick decision-making, and efficient collaborative working environment.

  - To enhance coordination, specific channels were designated for different aspects of the project, such as task assignments, troubleshooting, and general discussions, preventing information overload and ensuring clarity.

  - In addition to text-based discussions, voice calls and video meetings were occasionally scheduled to address more complex topics that required in-depth discussions. These meetings helped clarify intricate project details and allowed for more dynamic brainstorming sessions.

  - A shared document repository, such as Google Drive or GitHub, was used to organize and store project-related files, ensuring that all team members had access to the latest versions of important documents and code.

- **Decision-Making Process:**

  - Decisions were made collectively through a **voting system**, allowing all team members to voice their opinions.

  - Discussions were held prior to voting to thoroughly analyze options and consider all perspectives before reaching a consensus.

  - Most decisions were made with majority agreement, minimizing potential conflicts and ensuring smooth project progression.

  - On average, two voting rounds were conducted per major decision, allowing team members ample time to express concerns and refine choices if necessary.

  - For highly technical decisions, a designated subject-matter expert was consulted to provide additional insights, ensuring that decisions were based on well-informed reasoning rather than preference alone.

- **Prioritization & Meetings:**

  - Due to midterm season, **in-person meetings were challenging**, but the team remained highly active on **Discord**, engaging in discussions approximately **every other day**.

  - Virtual discussions were held approximately every other day, ensuring continuous progress and timely resolution of issues.

  - Task prioritization was guided by deadlines and complexity, with the team focusing on critical components first to reduce potential roadblocks.

  - Regular updates were shared to track progress, provide feedback, and address any emerging challenges, maintaining alignment with the project's overall goals and timeline.

  - A task management system, was utilized to visually track task assignments, deadlines, and progress, allowing for greater accountability and clarity regarding responsibilities.

  - Retrospective discussions were conducted periodically to evaluate completed tasks, identify areas for improvement, and adjust workflows as needed.

- **Lessons for Future Phases:**

  - The team should focus on **better time management and scheduling** to align with academic workloads.

  - Introducing **in-person meetings**, when feasible, could enhance productivity and improve workflow efficiency.
