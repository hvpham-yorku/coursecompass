## Motivation

Course Compass was created to **simplify university course selection**. Many students find existing course search tools **confusing, scattered, and lacking essential insights** such as **prerequisites, professor ratings, and workload estimates**, making it difficult to choose the right courses.

### Problems It Solves

- Difficult-to-use course search tools – University systems often require too many steps just to find basic course details.
- Lack of all-in-one insights – Students have to check multiple websites to find prerequisites, ratings, and workload expectations.
- Time-consuming research process – Comparing courses and planning a schedule takes long when information is disorganized.

### Why It Exists

Course Compass brings everything students need for course selection into **one easy-to-use platform**. It allows them to:  
**Quickly search for courses**  
**See prerequisites, professor ratings, and workload estimates in one place**  
**Plan their schedules without switching between multiple sites**
